--------Welcome to the Ateam 14's Quiz Generator!--------

Purpose:
	- This application is meant to generate quizzes 
	  based on topic and give results after taking each 
	  quiz.

How to use:
	- you can manually add single questions, or load 
	  questions from a .json file. Once you have added
	  enough questions, you can navigate to the home
	  page, choose the topic and  number of questions 
	  for your quiz, and click "Start Quiz" to take it.
	  Before you exit the application, you can also save
	  your uploaded questions into an external .json 
	  file so that you don't have to upload/input your
	  questions all over again. You just have to upload
	  a singular .json file.
	  Enjoy!

Trouble shooting ideas:

  Problem 1: Start quiz not working
	-Make sure, you have chosen a topic and the amount 
	 of questions that you want in your quiz.
	-Double check to make sure that the "# Questions" 
	 field does not contain any non integer digits or 
	 decimals.
	-If none of these solutions work, then try restarting
	 the program.
	
  Problem 2: A problem not listed
	-If you run into a problem not listed, then we probably
	 don't know how to fix it. However, we'd love it if you
	 would let us know so that we may trouble shoot this.
	 Thanks!
